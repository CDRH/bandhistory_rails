    <p>The Morrill Act, through which the University of Nebraska was created, stipulated that land grant institutions must support "...at least one college where the leading object shall be, without excluding other scientific and classical studies, and including military tactics, to teach such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts...". In 1876, to fulfill the Actâ€™s requirement for military tactics to be taught, the fledgling University established the Military Science program.</p>
